    **Project Aurelia** is an advanced AI assistant designed to help users extract meaningful insights from complex financial documents. 
    It leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to combine:

    - **Knowledge retrieval**: Efficiently searches large corpora of structured and unstructured documents to find relevant information.  
    - **Reasoning**: Uses AI reasoning to contextualize and synthesize answers tailored to your queries.  
    - **Contextual awareness**: Maintains conversation context to provide coherent, accurate, and actionable responses over multiple interactions.

    The system can answer financial questions, highlight key metrics, extract formulas, assess risk levels, and even suggest follow-up questions to deepen analysis. 
    It integrates real-time AI responses with document sourcing transparency, ensuring that all generated insights can be traced back to their source.

    For more details, source code, and implementation guidelines, refer to the [Project Aurelia GitHub repository](https://github.com/Big-Data-Team-3/project-aurelia).
